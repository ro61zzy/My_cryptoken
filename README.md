# My_cryptoken
build a cryptocurrency using ERC-20 tokens
Making an ERC20 token named ROZZY with symbol RZY

We set the contract and make it an instance of ERC20
then import OpenZeppelin(OZ) ERC20 code that set the standards instead of writing my own from scratch

When deploying, supply your contract with a name and a symbol for it.

After deploying, manually import your tokens under the assets, by pasting your contract address and import
You can send them to your friends!
